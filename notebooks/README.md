# Jupyter notebooks

## Howto
When the server starts, you'll get a notification that the notebooks web server can be reached from, e.g.:
```
localhost:8888/?token=2e12afd535c6bed4381fd95bc0cc834573f5b55a78b074da
```
To connect from outside the container simply swap the port with whatever port is used to connect to the docker container, defined in the docker-compose file.
